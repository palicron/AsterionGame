DEDALUS: I bid you a mournful welcome, creature. I am DEADALUS, gatekeeper and architect of this place: my LABYRINTH
my withering carcass, my prison… and your tomb. 
Fight not the FATE you have been spun, as I do not fight my own.
ASTERION: ... 
DEDALUS: It is not willingness to die that brings death to all beings, creature. 
ASTERION: … 
DEDALUS: The doorway and exit are one and the same.
It lies elsewhere, ever moving. Find it, you cannot. Reach it, you cannot.  
ASTERION: … 
DEDALUS: The gods dwell not in the shadows of this corpse. 
Hear your prayer, they cannot. 
Show you the way, they cannot… nor would they heed the words of one such as you, creature. 
Affront to POSEIDON, bane of MINOS, shame of CRETE. 
ASTERION: … 
DEDALUS: This is your lot in life, creature. 
We choose not our own FATES. 
ASTERION: … 
DEDALUS: Perhaps, creature, your FATE lies elsewhere. 
I cannot tell. But there is no escape from my LABYRINTH: no man can best my creation and no god will aid in your plight. 
In here you will only find death.
ASTERION: … 
DEDALUS: You amuse me, creature.
None so bold as yourself have ever stepped in this godforsaken place. 
If so hasteful you are of meeting your end, two things I will do for you. 
DEDALUS: Take the LABRYS: the blades that were to end the life of your sire, the WHITE BULL, might still serve you.
DEDALUS: There lays the path to the center of the LABYRINTH. 
If you ever reach it, creature, you might find the way out.
ASTERION: … 
DEDALUS: *chuckle* Very well: ASTERION I shall call you, creature.
